ðŸŒ± Project Overview: Plant Disease Detection Web App
Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity, leading to economic losses for farmers and threatening global food security. 
Traditional disease diagnosis methods are time-consuming, require expert knowledge, and are often inaccessible to farmers in rural areas. 
#Problem Statement:
To address this challenge, we developed an AI-powered Plant Disease Detection Web Application that leverages a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate disease prediction and integrates with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) agent (Gemini) to provide personalized recommendations and treatment advice. The app is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with two Python Flask microservices handling image prediction and AI-driven recommendations.
#system's architecture:
The system's architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and efficient communication between services, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences. Users can upload plant images directly from their device, receive instant diagnosis results, and access an interactive dashboard to track their plant analysis history.
By combining AI/ML, modern web technologies, and an intuitive UI/UX, this solution empowers farmers, gardeners, and agricultural stakeholders with a reliable, accessible, and cost-effective tool to monitor and manage plant health. 
Its Unique Selling Points (USPs) include real-time disease detection, AI-driven recommendations tailored to user input (such as water frequency and language preference), secure user authentication with JWT, and a history tracking feature for continuous plant health monitoringâ€”making it an impactful innovation towards smarter, sustainable agriculture
