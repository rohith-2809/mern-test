We use two distinct deep learning models to address different use cases:

Binary Classification Model: Detects whether a plant is healthy or diseased.

Multiclass Classification Model: Identifies the specific disease affecting the plant.

Both models are built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to their ability to extract and learn meaningful features from image data.

Binary Classification Model
✅ Purpose
This model classifies an input image into two categories:

Healthy
Diseased

It serves as a first-line diagnostic tool, providing a simple yes/no answer on whether the plant shows signs of disease.

2. Multiclass Classification Model
✅ Purpose
This model classifies an image into multiple disease categories, providing specific diagnoses.

📚 Example Classes (Adjust for your case)
Healthy
Bacterial Spot
Early Blight
Late Blight
Leaf Mold
Septoria Leaf Spot
Target Spot
Mosaic Virus
Etc.

🏗️ Architecture


This CNN is deeper and more complex than the binary model to capture fine-grained features that differentiate between diseases.

📝 Conclusion
We've built two powerful deep learning models for plant disease detection.

The Binary Model is lightweight, great for quick screening.
The Multiclass Model is more detailed, enabling specific diagnosis and tailored treatments.
These models can empower farmers, agronomists, and researchers to detect and control plant diseases more efficiently, ensuring healthier crops and better yields.
